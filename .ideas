Notes

- how to switch between readonly and edit state for each event item ?
-- need a reusable event-item form component for Create and Edit actions
--- Create : will add an instance of the form with empty fields
--- Edit : will add an instance of the form getting the selected item as @Input()
-- need a reusable readonly component for view mode / does material readonly state on form-fields would allow to reuse the same event-item form component ?

- Time : 24h format
-- get the user local ?

- the undo/redo feature can be done using Redux pattern -> NgRx for Angular
-- interesting lib for a quick use : https://github.com/JannicBeck/ngrx-undoable
